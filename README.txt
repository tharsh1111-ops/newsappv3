WebSmash News Search Application

Created by Tom Harsh

OVERVIEW:
---------
Please enjoy this news search application!

The primary user experience is keyword search to multiple news sources around the world.
Some buttons perform the function of other buttons for open all, etc.....that is so how you want to select and query is definable.

When you have areas of interest filled in, name the session and save it. You can then easily open it quickly as desired.

MANAGING NEWS SOURCES:
---------------------
You can edit News Sources from the Manage link page and enter, edit, delete or reorder them in their Regional Column.

Note: News source websites use keyword search implementation in different ways. Some do not play well and only allow search from their web page, even though this application is integrated to a news source API.

Simply run WebSmash.exe to start the application.
To close the app, simply close the window.
